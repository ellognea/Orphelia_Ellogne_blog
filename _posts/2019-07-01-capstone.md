<div align="justify">  
For my Capstone project, I collaborated with <a href="https://github.com/hfboyce">Hayley Boyce</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ksm45">Maninder Kohli</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rachelkriggs">Rachel K. Riggs</a> to help improve <a href="https://www.freshprep.ca/">Fresh Prepâ€™s</a> weekly orders prediction accuracy. In this post, I summarize our work and the lessons learnt. Due to NDA restrictions, I do not include any confidential information such as descriptive statistics.

**Project Background**

Fresh Prep is a Vancouver-based meal kit delivery company that strives to help their customers cook quick and healthy dinners. They offer a weekly rotating menu with 10 recipes and are committed to sustainability.

A Fresh Prep customer has a status of either _active_ or _paused_. Orders are automatically generated for all customers regardless of status; however, for paused customers these orders are also automatically skipped. Our goal therefore was to determine which active status customers take action to opt-out as well as which paused customers take action to opt-in.

To answer our main question: **How many orders are expected in the upcoming weeks?**, we answered a slightly harder question: **which customers will be ordering in the upcoming weeks?**.
Answering the latter question not only provides Fresh Prep with the number of orders predicted for a given week, but also allows them to target undecided customers. 

Overall, our work was focused in three main areas:
- Analyze customer behavior to reveal patterns and trends
- Improve weekly orders prediction accuracy
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard that displays predictions and client information
