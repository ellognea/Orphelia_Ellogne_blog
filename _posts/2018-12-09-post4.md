title: Relationship between gender and math grades
---

 
I completed my first project-based course: **Data science workflows** which focused on reproducibility of data analysis projects. I learnt to: 
<br>
  
- Write R, Python and shell scripts for non-interactive data analysis

- Automate data science workflows (using e.g., Make)

- Manage project software and environment dependencies (using e.g., Docker)

- Use a Git/GitHub forking-pull request collaboration approach to collaboratively work on a data analysis project

My teammate and I worked with the UCI Student Performance Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) to evaluate the relationship between a student gender (Female/Male) and their final math grade.
We reported the results of a two-tailed hypothesis test that determine if there was a statistically significant difference in the mean math grade for male and female students. We also created a visualization of the data that shows the mean, confidence intervals and distribution for each sample (Female and Male).
