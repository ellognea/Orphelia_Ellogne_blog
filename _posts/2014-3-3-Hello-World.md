How does my laptop know my dress style?

My interest in data science started in 2012 when I began online shopping. Having moved to the US from a country where e-commerce did not exist, the continuous advertisements and recommendations that were closely related to my purchases ignited my curiosity. I came to learn that they were all applications of data science.  Three years later, I moved to the supplier side at General Electric. Just as the targeted advertisements aimed to influence my purchasing decisions as a college student, our customersâ€™ gas turbine requirements were coded to generate virtual power plants.  Thanks to data science, I virtually walked through the gas turbines I was continually hearing about. My interest culminated. I decided to further explore the challenges and opportunities that data offered.
