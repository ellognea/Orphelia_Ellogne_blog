I completed my first project-based course: ** Data science workflows ** which focused on reproducibility of data analysis projects. I learnt to: 

- Write R, Python and shell scripts for non-interactive data analysis

- Use a Git/GitHub forking-pull request collaboration approach to collaboratively work on a data analysis project

- Automate data science workflows (using e.g., Make)

- Manage project software and environment dependencies (using e.g., Docker)
