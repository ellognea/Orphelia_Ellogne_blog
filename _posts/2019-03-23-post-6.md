title: Extracting Game of Thrones data from Wikipedia
---

<div align="justify">
 
I'm learning different methods to import data from the web in my <b>Web and Cloud Computing </b> class. This week, I learnt web scrapping with <i>BeautifulSoup</i>, a python package for extracting data out of HTML and XML files. <br>
In this post, I show how I collected Game of Thrones data from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_Thrones_episodes"> this Wikipedia page</a> that lists all Game of Thrones episodes by season. More specifically, I scrapped and summarized in a pandas dataframe, all episodes' titles, links, seasons, number of U.S. viewers, and running time .

Cool ! right ? Looking forward to learning Application Programming Interface (API) next week.
