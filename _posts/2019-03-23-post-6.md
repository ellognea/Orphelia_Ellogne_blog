title: Extracting Game of Thrones data from Wikipedia
---
<div align="justify">
 
I'm learning different ways to import data from the web in my **Web and Cloud Computing** class. This week, I learnt web scrapping with  *BeautifulSoup*, a python package for extracting data out of HTML and XML files. 
<br>
In this post, I show how I collected Game of Thrones data from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_Thrones_episodes"> this Wikipedia page</a> that lists all Game of Thrones episodes by season. More specifically, I scrapped and summarized in a pandas dataframe, all episodes' titles, links, seasons, number of U.S. viewers, and running time .
