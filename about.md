I love data ! 
<br>
In 2015, I earned a bachelor's degree in Economics-Mathematics from Reed College (Portland, Oregon), then worked 3 years as a financial analyst in Nigeria, Kenya, France and New York. I realized I had more fun working on projects involving raw data analysis and process automation.
<br>
I went back to school in 2018, to explore the power of computer science and statistics. I will be ready to start my data science career in July 2019.
