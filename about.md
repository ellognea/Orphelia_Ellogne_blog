I love data ! I earned a bachelor degree in Economics-Mathematics from Reed College (Portland, Oregon), then worked 3 years as a financial analyst in Nigeria, Kenya, France and New York. I will be ready to start my data scientist career in July 2019. (add why you returned to data science and add more visual words)
